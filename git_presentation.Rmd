# Learning Goals

## By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- Access the web interface of Github
- Use the bash shell to interact with Github (basic interaction)
- Clone a repository from Github
- Add & commit changes to version controlled files on Github, and on your local machine
- Push local changes to Github

# Additional reasons to learn Git & Github

- Github (website) can act as a back-up for files housed there
- Github can be used to host websites/blogs
- Github has a fantastic search functionality

And git is the language we have to speak to communicate with Github. Sometimes is a quirky language.

# Get yourself a Github account!

https://github.com/

---
# Create a repository on Github

Go to https://github.com and make sure you are logged in.

Click green “New repository” button. Or, if you are on your own profile page, click on “Repositories”, then click the green “New” button.

Choose/set:
- Repository name: myrepo (or whatever you wish, we will delete this)
- Public
- YES Initialize this repository with a README

Click big green button “Create repository.”

Copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button.

---
# Adding & commiting changes to version controlled files

There are two ways to make changes to your files:

1. Edit files directly on Github.
2. Make changes on files you have cloned locally to your computer, and then "push" the changes back to Github.
 
---
# Edit files directly on Github

Click on the `README.md` file link

Click on the pen tool (right-hand side of document)

Add your name as the author to the document (e.g., "author: Tiffany Timbers")

Click on the big green button "Commit changes" to save your work

--- 
# Configuring Git locally

Before we can `clone` the repository from Github to our local machines, we need to set up the Git configurations on all the laptops. 

To do this, open a terminal or Git for Windows and type the following (using your user-specific details for the first two commands):

```
git config --global user.name "First_Name Last_Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.address"
git config --global color.ui "auto"
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

For more details, see Software Carpentry's lesson on [setting up Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/)

---
# Cloning repositories from Github

If you want to be able to run the code on your own machine, and modify it there, we need to "clone" it. 

To clone it:

1. go into the repository (your copy of it)
2. click on the green "Clone or download" button (make sure the pop-up says "Clone with HTTPS")
3. copy the URL to the clipboard
4. open a Unix Shell instance (e.g., terminal in RStudio) on your laptop
5. navigate to your `Documents` directory
  ```
  cd Documents
  ```
6. type `git clone` and paste the URL
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/github_username/repository_name.git
  ```
7. press enter to clone the repository to your local machine
    
For more details, see Github's docs on [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

---
# Making changes locally

Open the README.md file in R Studio and make another change (e.g., add today's date to the file). 

Save the changes to that file.

---
# Add and commit your changes to Git

Once you have made a change to a file in a Git repository that you have locally (*i.e.,* on your laptop), you need to add and commit the changes.

Committing the changes is essentially saving the differences between the new version of the document and the previous version of the document in the hidden `.git` directory in the Git repository.

- This is a two stage process with Git:
    1. Add changes to staging area
        ```
        git add file_name(s)
        ```
        
    2. Commit changes to hidden `.git` directory
        ```
        git commit -m "Some useful message about the changes you made"
        ```

---
# How do I know if I made changes?

`git status` is a friendly command that lets you know if you have changes that you have yet to add or commit.

---
# Push local changes to Github

Once you have made local changes, and added and committed them, you need to "push" the changes to Github:

```
git push
```

For more details, see Github's doc on [pushing changes to Github](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).

---
# What if I make more changes directly on Github? 

---
# Pull changes made on Github to your local machine

If you make changes remotely on Github, and then afterwards want to make additional changes locally on your computer, you must first `pull` the changes from Github to your local machine:

```
git pull origin master
```

For more details, see Github's docs on [pulling changes from Github to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/#pull).

*If you forget to `pull` the changes on the remote before you make and commit your local changes, you will get **rejected** when you go to `push` the new changes to Github.*

---
# What to do if my `push` gets rejected?

1. `pull` the remote changes to your local machine:
    ```
    git pull origin master
    ```
2. Deal with any merge conflicts you may have and `add` and `commit` these changes:
    - see [Resolving a merge conflict from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/)
    
3. `push` the changes to Github
    ```
    git push origin master
    ```

---
# Creating new files in your repository

Sometimes you will need to creat a brand new file to add to your Github repository. Again, you have two options to do this:

1. Create new files locally to your computer inside the directory housing the repository, `add` & `commit` this change, and then `push` the changes back to Github.

2. Create the new file directly on Github using the "Create new file" button.
    - see Github's docs on [creating new files](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/)

# Accessing and reading issues on Github

Issues are messages associated with a Github repository. They live in the "Issues" tab inside a Github repository

Issues:
- are like emails (they will even be delivered to your inbox!) that stay linked to the repository.
- are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for projects on GitHub (we will also be using them to send you your grades on assignments and quizzes).
- are searchable.
- can be edited, but not be deleted (unless you delete the entire repository).
- exist in a state of "open" (need to be dealt with) or "closed" (nothing needs to be done).

For more details, see Github's docs on [issues on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-projects-with-issues/)
